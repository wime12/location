This program queries the Yahoo geolocation database.

### How to query the database ###

Point the variable awklib in the shell script location.sh to the
directory where location.awk is and call the script with a name of
the place. If matching places are found, a list of place names with
additional information is displayed. The WOEID can for example be
used for the weather script.
