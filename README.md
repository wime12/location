This program queries the Yahoo geolocation database.

### How to query the database ###

Point the variable awklib in the shell script location.sh to the directory
where location.awk is and call the script with a name of the place. If
matching places are found, a list of place names with additional
information is displayed. The WOEID can be used for the weather
script.
